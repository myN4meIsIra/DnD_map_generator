# DnD Map Generator 

I love D&D, so I wanted to program something that could help to make a game master's life easier, since drawing and coming up with maps is so slow.
Enter, the DnD map generator, a state of the art program which creates these maps on it's own. And, as if that wasn't impressive enough, you can even download the image files. Wow.

# Execution 
Run main.py, and it should all work right
building_rules.py contains a JSON-esque ruleset list for what elements can be built for conditions

(currently no map-generation-implementation for roads)
